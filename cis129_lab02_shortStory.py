print('Hello, people!')
print("Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a curious child named Fernando.")
print("Every day, Fernandp dreamed of exploring the enchanted forest nearby.")
print("One sunny morning, Fernando decided to embark on an adventure.")
print("With a small backpack filled with snacks and a trusty map, Fernando waved goodbye to the village.")
print("As Fernando entered the forest, the trees whispered secrets, and the sunlight danced on the leaves.")
print("Suddenly, a friendly rabbit appeared and said, 'Follow me for a magical surprise!'")
print("Intrigued, Fernando followed the rabbit deeper into the woods.")
print("They came across a sparkling stream where colorful fish swam gracefully.")
print("The rabbit pointed to a shimmering cave and exclaimed, 'This is the treasure of the forest!'")
print("Inside the cave, Fernando found glowing crystals and treasures beyond imagination.")
print("With a heart full of joy, Fernando returned home, knowing that every day could bring a new adventure.")
print("And from that day on, Fernando explored the forest often, making new friends and discovering magic everywhere.")
print("The end.")
